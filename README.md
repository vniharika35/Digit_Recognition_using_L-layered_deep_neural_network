In this project, I have implemented an L-layered deep neural network and train it on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains scanned images of handwritten digits, along with their correct classification labels (between 0-9). MNIST's name comes from the fact that it is a modified subset of two data sets collected by NIST, the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology.
